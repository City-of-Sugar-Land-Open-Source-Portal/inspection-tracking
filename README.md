This is a public-facing, custom web application interfacing with an on-prem EnerGov ERP to allow citizens or contractors to track their inspections for the current day. 
City inspectors connect to EnerGov to download their inspections for the day. The inspection records are copied over to the web application's own database. Inspectors can then use the app to arrange their inspections in the order that is appropriate to their route and schedule. They may continue to re-order their remaining inspections throughout the day as necessary. This part of the app is available only to City employees using Azure Active Directory authentication and authorization.
The public page of the app simply allows citizens or contractors to enter their permit# or IVR#. If there is an inspection scheduled for that day, the app provides information about their inspector, the inspector's total number of inspections for that day, their inspection's order/sequence for that day, the number of inspections already completed and the number of inspections left before theirs. As a web application, users will need to refresh the page to get the current status.
Inspectors are allowed to notify the next inspection thru e-mail when they finish their current inspection. They will specify their ETA to the next inspection to give advance notice. Note that citizen's or contractor's contact information is only available if they provided that during the permit application or inspection request.
